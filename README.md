# Gradient Background Builder

A modern, browser-based studio for crafting cinematic gradient backgrounds with layered texture controls.
Generate polished wallpapers, hero images, and social cards by combining deterministic seeds, curated presets,
and export-ready canvas sizes.

## Project overview

This project is a Vite + React app that renders custom gradient backgrounds on an HTML canvas. It focuses on
repeatable results (seeded randomness), fine-grained creative controls, and quick export workflows for PNG
backgrounds.

## What’s included

- **Preset scenes** for quick starting points (Aurora, Prism, Sunset, Ocean, Candy, Vertex Flow, and more).
- **Seeded randomization** with a lock toggle to reproduce exact results later.
- **Gradient controls** for type, angle, softness, and multi-color palettes.
- **Noise + pattern layers** with toggles, intensity, scale, and style options.
- **Export tooling** including common canvas sizes, custom dimensions, and one-click PNG downloads.
- **Config sharing** via copy/paste JSON to collaborate or save exact settings.

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open the local dev server URL printed by Vite.

## Build for production

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## Contributing

This is a hobby project created with Codex (OpenAI). Contributions are welcome—feel free to open issues or
pull requests for enhancements, new presets, or performance improvements.
